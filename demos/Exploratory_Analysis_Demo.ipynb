I'm pretty sure the answer is no! Attention is really good at the primitive operations of looking nearby, or copying information. I can believe a tiny model could figure out that at `to` it should look for names and predict that those names came next (eg the skip trigram \" John...to -> John\"). But it's much harder to tell how <i>many</i> of each previous name there are - attending 0.3 to each copy of John will look exactly the same as attending 0.6 to a single John token.

This is *almost* a linear map, apart from the scaling step, because that divides by the norm of the vector and the norm is not a linear function.

To use it in practice with TransformerLens, see [this demonstration instead](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens/blob/main/demos/Activation_Patching_in_TL_Demo.ipynb)**.\n",

                "The obvious limitation to the techniques used above is that they only look at the very end of the circuit - the parts that directly affect the logits. Clearly this is not sufficient to understand the circuit! We want to understand how things compose together to produce this final output, and ideally to produce an end-to-end circuit fully explaining this behaviour. \n",
                "\n",
                "The technique we'll use to investigate this is called **activation patching**. This was first introduced in [David Bau and Kevin Meng's excellent ROME paper](https://rome.baulab.info/), there called causal tracing. \n",
                "\n",
                "The setup of activation patching is to take two runs of the model on two different inputs, the clean run and the corrupted run. The clean run outputs the correct answer and the corrupted run does not. The key idea is that we give the model the corrupted input, but then **intervene** on a specific activation and **patch** in the corresponding activation from the clean run (ie replace the corrupted activation with the clean activation), and then continue the run. And we then measure how much the output has updated towards the correct answer. \n",
                "\n",
                "We can then iterate over many possible activations and look at how much they affect the corrupted run. If patching in an activation significantly increases the probability of the correct answer, this allows us to *localise* which activations matter. \n",
                "\n",
                "The ability to localise is a key move in mechanistic interpretability - if the computation is diffuse and spread across the entire model, it is likely much harder to form a clean mechanistic story for what's going on. But if we can identify precisely which parts of the model matter, we can then zoom in and determine what they represent and how they connect up with each other, and ultimately reverse engineer the underlying circuit that they represent. \n",

This is in some ways much lower effort (you don't need to set up a similar but different prompt) but can also introduce some issues, such as ways this noise might break things. In practice, you should take care about how you choose your counterfactuals and try out several.

                "Decomposing attention layers into patching in individual heads has already helped us localise the behaviour a lot. But we can understand it further by decomposing heads. An attention head consists of two semi-independent operations - calculating *where* to move information from and to (represented by the attention pattern and implemented via the QK-circuit) and calculating *what* information to move (represented by the value vectors and implemented by the OV circuit). We can disentangle which of these is important by patching in just the attention pattern *or* the value vectors. (See [A Mathematical Framework](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) or [my walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV5gbOmHbjU) for more on this decomposition. If you're not familiar with the details of how attention is implemented, I recommend checking out [my clean transformer implementation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens/blob/clean-transformer-demo/Clean_Transformer_Demo.ipynb#scrollTo=3Pb0NYbZ900e) to see how the code works))"

                "\n",
                "First off, what's an induction head? An induction head is an important type of attention head that can detect and continue repeated sequences. It is the second head in a two head induction circuit, which looks for previous copies of the current token and attends to the token *after* it, and then copies that to the current position and predicts that it will come next. They're enough of a big deal that [we wrote a whole paper on them](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html).\n",

                "Second, why is it surprising that they come up here? It's surprising because it feels like overkill. The model doesn't care about *what* token comes after the first copy of the subject, just that it's duplicated. And it already has simpler duplicate token heads. My best guess is that it just already had induction heads around and that, in addition to their main function, they *also* only activate on duplicated tokens. So it was useful to repurpose this existing machinery. \n",
                "\n",
                "This suggests that as we look for circuits in larger models life may get more and more complicated, as components in simpler circuits get repurposed and built upon. "

                "One implication of this is that it's useful to categories heads according to whether they occur in simpler circuits, so that as we look for more complex circuits we can easily look for them. This is easy to do here! An interesting fact about induction heads is that they work on a sequence of repeated random tokens - notable for being wildly off distribution from the natural language GPT-2 was trained on. Being able to predict a model's behaviour off distribution is a good mark of success for mechanistic interpretability! This is a good sanity check for whether a head is an induction head or not. \n",

                "We can characterise an induction head by just giving a sequence of random tokens repeated once, and measuring the average attention paid from the second copy of a token to the token after the first copy. At the same time, we can also measure the average attention paid from the second copy of a token to the first copy of the token, which is the attention that the induction head would pay if it were a duplicate token head, and the average attention paid to the previous token to find previous token heads.\n",

                "Note that this is a superficial study of whether something is an induction head - we totally ignore the question of whether it actually does boost the correct token or whether it composes with a single previous head and how. In particular, we sometimes get anti-induction heads which suppress the induction-y token (no clue why!), and this technique will find those too . But given the previous rigorous analysis, we can be pretty confident that this picks up on some true signal about induction heads.\n",

Previously names_filter was the name of the activation, but here it's a boolean function mapping activation names to whether we want to hook them or not. Here it's just whether the name ends with hook_attn. hook_fn must take in the two inputs activation (the activation tensor) and hook (the HookPoint object, which contains the name of the activation and some metadata such as the current layer).\n",

Different offsets give a different length of output tensor, and we can now just average to get a score in [0, 1] for each head\n",

                "Another fascinating anomaly is that of the **backup name mover heads**. A standard technique to apply when interpreting model internals is ablations, or knock-out. If we run the model but intervene to set a specific head to zero, what happens? If the model is robust to this intervention, then naively we can be confident that the head is not doing anything important, and conversely if the model is much worse at the task this suggests that head was important. There are several conceptual flaws with this approach, making the evidence only suggestive, eg that the average output of the head may be far from zero and so the knockout may send it far from expected activations, breaking internals on *any* task. But it's still an easy technique to apply to give some data.\n",

If we knock out one of the name movers, then there are some backup name movers in later layers that *change their behaviour* and do (some of) the job of the original name mover head. This means that naive knock-out will significantly underestimate the importance of the name movers.\n"

So we can directly access the hook on the z activation with `model.blocks[layer].attn.hook_z` and call its `add_hook` method. This adds in the hook to the *global state* of the model. We can now use run_with_cache, and don't need to care about the global state, because run_with_cache internally adds a bunch of caching hooks, and then removes all hooks after the run, *including* the previously added ablation hook. This can be disabled with the reset_hooks_end flag, but here it's useful! \n",
