It is a fact about the world today that we have computer programs that can essentially speak English at a human level (GPT-3, PaLM, etc), yet we have no idea how they work nor how to write one ourselves. This offends me greatly, and I would like to solve this! Mechanistic interpretability is a very young and small field, and there are a *lot* of open problems - if you would like to help, please try working on one! **If you want to skill up, check out [my guide to getting started](https://neelnanda.io/getting-started), and if you want to jump into an open problem check out my sequence [200 Concrete Open Problems in Mechanistic Interpretability](https://neelnanda.io/concrete-open-problems).**\n",

There's a lot of excellent infrastructure like HuggingFace and DeepSpeed to *use* or *train* models, but very little to dig into their internals and reverse engineer how they work. **This library tries to solve that**, and to make it easy to get into the field even if you don't work at an industry org with real infrastructure! The core features were heavily inspired by [Anthropic's excellent Garcon tool](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/garcon/index.html). Credit to Nelson Elhage and Chris Olah for building Garcon and showing me the value of good infrastructure for accelerating exploratory research!\n",

The point of this library is to keep the gap between having an experiment idea and seeing the results as small as possible, to make it easy for **research to feel like play** and to enter a flow state. This notebook demonstrates how the library works and how to use it, but if you want to see how well it works for exploratory research, check out [my notebook analysing Indirect Objection Identification](https://neelnanda.io/exploratory-analysis-demo) or [my recording of myself doing research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo4QvDn-vsU)!"

This means that you can intervene within a layer on each activation, and don't need to care about the precise layer structure of the transformer.

But you can easily shoot yourself in the foot if there's, eg, an error in one of your hooks so the function never finishes. If you start getting bugs, try `model.reset_hooks()` to clean things up. Further, if you *do* add hooks of your own that you want to keep, which you can do with `add_perma_hook` on the relevant HookPoint"

The goal is to identify which model activations are important for completing a task. We do this by setting up a **clean prompt** and a **corrupted prompt** and a **metric** for performance on the task. We then pick a specific model activation, run the model on the corrupted prompt, but then *intervene* on that activation and patch in its value when run on the clean prompt. We then apply the metric, and see how much this patch has recovered the clean performance. \n",

                "In transformer interpretability, we often need to analyse low rank factorized matrices - a matrix $M = AB$, where M is `[large, large]`, but A is `[large, small]` and B is `[small, large]`. This is a common structure in transformers, and the `FactoredMatrix` class is a convenient way to work with these. It implements efficient algorithms for various operations on these, such as computing the trace, eigenvalues, Frobenius norm, singular value decomposition, and products with other matrices. It can (approximately) act as a drop-in replacement for the original matrix, and supports leading batch dimensions to the factored matrix. \n",

Because this is low rank, it can be thought of as *reading in* some low rank subspace of the source residual stream and *writing to* some low rank subspace of the destination residual stream (with maybe some processing happening in the middle).\n",

They find a pretty dramatic shift in models during training - there's a brief period where models go from not having induction heads to having them, which leads to the models suddenly becoming much better at in-context learning (using far back tokens to predict the next token, eg over 500 words back). This is enough of a big deal that it leads to a visible *bump* in the loss curve, where the model's rate of improvement briefly increases. "
