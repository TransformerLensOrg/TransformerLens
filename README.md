A Library for Mechanistic Interpretability of Generative Language Models. Maintained by [Bryce Meyer](https://github.com/bryce13950) and created by [Neel Nanda](https://neelnanda.io/about)

This is a library for doing [mechanistic
interpretability](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/) of GPT-2 Style language models. The
goal of mechanistic interpretability is to take a trained model and reverse engineer the algorithms
the model learned during training from its weights.

TransformerLens lets you load in 50+ different open source language models, and exposes the internal
activations of the model to you. You can cache any internal activation in the model, and add in
functions to edit, remove or replace these activations as the model runs.

## Quick Start

### Install

```shell
pip install transformer_lens
```

### Use

```python
import transformer_lens

# Load a model (eg GPT-2 Small)
model = transformer_lens.HookedTransformer.from_pretrained("gpt2-small")

# Run the model and get logits and activations
logits, activations = model.run_with_cache("Hello World")
```

## Getting Started in Mechanistic Interpretability

Mechanistic interpretability is a very young and small field, and there are a _lot_ of open
problems. This means there's both a lot of low-hanging fruit, and that the bar for entry is low - if
you would like to help, please try working on one! The standard answer to "why has no one done this
yet" is just that there aren't enough people! Key resources:

* [A Guide to Getting Started in Mechanistic Interpretability](https://neelnanda.io/getting-started)
* [ARENA Mechanistic Interpretability Tutorials](https://arena3-chapter1-transformer-interp.streamlit.app/) from

  TransformerLens - full of snippets to copy and they come with exercises and solutions! Notable

## Credits

This library was created by **[Neel Nanda](https://neelnanda.io)** and is maintained by **[Bryce Meyer](https://github.com/bryce13950)**.

The core features of TransformerLens were heavily inspired by the interface to [Anthropic's
excellent Garcon tool](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/garcon/index.html). Credit to Nelson
Elhage and Chris Olah for building Garcon and showing the value of good infrastructure for enabling
exploratory research!

### Creator's Note (Neel Nanda)

I (Neel Nanda) used to work for the [Anthropic interpretability team](transformer-circuits.pub), and
I wrote this library because after I left and tried doing independent research, I got extremely
frustrated by the state of open source tooling. There's a lot of excellent infrastructure like
HuggingFace and DeepSpeed to _use_ or _train_ models, but very little to dig into their internals
and reverse engineer how they work. **This library tries to solve that**, and to make it easy to get
into the field even if you don't work at an industry org with real infrastructure! One of the great
things about mechanistic interpretability is that you don't need large models or tons of compute.
There are lots of important open problems that can be solved with a small model in a Colab notebook!
