    "This is a demo notebook for [TransformerLens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens), **a library I ([Neel Nanda](https://neelnanda.io)) wrote for doing [mechanistic interpretability](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/) of GPT-2 Style language models.** The goal of mechanistic interpretability is to take a trained model and reverse engineer the algorithms the model learned during training from its weights. It is a fact about the world today that we have computer programs that can essentially speak English at a human level (GPT-3, PaLM, etc), yet we have no idea how they work nor how to write one ourselves. This offends me greatly, and I would like to solve this! Mechanistic interpretability is a very young and small field, and there are a *lot* of open problems - if you would like to help, please try working on one! **If you want to skill up, check out [my guide to getting started](https://neelnanda.io/getting-started), and if you want to jump into an open problem check out my sequence [200 Concrete Open Problems in Mechanistic Interpretability](https://neelnanda.io/concrete-open-problems).**\n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote this library because after I left the Anthropic interpretability team and started doing independent research, I got extremely frustrated by the state of open source tooling. There's a lot of excellent infrastructure like HuggingFace and DeepSpeed to *use* or *train* models, but very little to dig into their internals and reverse engineer how they work. **This library tries to solve that**, and to make it easy to get into the field even if you don't work at an industry org with real infrastructure! The core features were heavily inspired by [Anthropic's excellent Garcon tool](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/garcon/index.html). Credit to Nelson Elhage and Chris Olah for building Garcon and showing me the value of good infrastructure for accelerating exploratory research!\n",
    "\n",
    "The core design principle I've followed is to enable exploratory analysis - one of the most fun parts of mechanistic interpretability compared to normal ML is the extremely short feedback loops! The point of this library is to keep the gap between having an experiment idea and seeing the results as small as possible, to make it easy for **research to feel like play** and to enter a flow state. This notebook demonstrates how the library works and how to use it, but if you want to see how well it works for exploratory research, check out [my notebook analysing Indirect Objection Identification](https://neelnanda.io/exploratory-analysis-demo) or [my recording of myself doing research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo4QvDn-vsU)!"

    "One of the great things about interpreting neural networks is that we have *full control* over our system. From a computational perspective, we know exactly what operations are going on inside (even if we don't know what they mean!). And we can make precise, surgical edits and see how the model's behaviour and other internals change. This is an extremely powerful tool, because it can let us eg set up careful counterfactuals and causal intervention to easily understand model behaviour. \n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly, being able to do this is a pretty core operation, and this is one of the main things TransformerLens supports! The key feature here is **hook points**. Every activation inside the transformer is surrounded by a hook point, which allows us to edit or intervene on it. \n",
    "\n",
    "We do this by adding a **hook function** to that activation. The hook function maps `current_activation_value, hook_point` to `new_activation_value`. As the model is run, it computes that activation as normal, and then the hook function is applied to compute a replacement, and that is substituted in for the activation. The hook function can be an arbitrary Python function, so long as it returns a tensor of the correct shape.\n",

    "\n",
    "[PyTorch hooks](https://blog.paperspace.com/pytorch-hooks-gradient-clipping-debugging/) are a great and underrated, yet incredibly janky, feature. They can act on a layer, and edit the input or output of that layer, or the gradient when applying autodiff. The key difference is that **Hook points** act on *activations* not layers. This means that you can intervene within a layer on each activation, and don't need to care about the precise layer structure of the transformer. And it's immediately clear exactly how the hook's effect is applied. This adjustment was shamelessly inspired by [Garcon's use of ProbePoints](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/garcon/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "They also come with a range of other quality of life improvements, like the model having a `model.reset_hooks()` method to remove all hooks, or helper methods to temporarily add hooks for a single forward pass - it is *incredibly* easy to shoot yourself in the foot with standard PyTorch hooks!\n",

But you can easily shoot yourself in the foot if there's, eg, an error in one of your hooks so the function never finishes. If you start getting bugs, try `model.reset_hooks()` to clean things up.

The goal is to identify which model activations are important for completing a task. We do this by setting up a **clean prompt** and a **corrupted prompt** and a **metric** for performance on the task. We then pick a specific model activation, run the model on the corrupted prompt, but then *intervene* on that activation and patch in its value when run on the clean prompt. We then apply the metric, and see how much this patch has recovered the clean performance. \n",

    "Induction circuits are a very important circuit in generative language models, which are used to detect and continue repeated subsequences. They consist of two heads in separate layers that compose together, a **previous token head** which always attends to the previous token, and an **induction head** which attends to the token *after* an earlier copy of the current token. \n",

    "To see why this is important, let's say that the model is trying to predict the next token in a news article about Michael Jordan. The token \" Michael\", in general, could be followed by many surnames. But an induction head will look from that occurence of \" Michael\" to the token after previous occurences of \" Michael\", ie \" Jordan\" and can confidently predict that that will come next."

    "LayerNorm is a normalization technique used by transformers, analogous to BatchNorm but more friendly to massive parallelisation. No one *really* knows why it works, but it seems to improve model numerical stability. Unlike BatchNorm, LayerNorm actually changes the functional form of the model, which makes it a massive pain for interpretability! \n",
    "\n",
    "Folding LayerNorm is a technique to make it lower overhead to deal with, and the flags `center_writing_weights` and `fold_ln` in `HookedTransformer.from_pretrained` apply this automatically (they default to True). These simplify the internal structure without changing the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, LayerNorm acts on each residual stream vector (ie for each batch element and token position) independently, sets their mean to 0 (centering) and standard deviation to 1 (normalizing) (*across* the residual stream dimension - very weird!), and then applies a learned elementwise scaling and translation to each vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, centering is a linear map, normalizing is *not* a linear map, and scaling and translation are linear maps. \n",
    "* **Centering:** LayerNorm is applied every time a layer reads from the residual stream, so the mean of any residual stream vector can never matter - `center_writing_weights` set every weight matrix writing to the residual to have zero mean. \n",
    "* **Normalizing:** Normalizing is not a linear map, and cannot be factored out. The `hook_scale` hook point lets you access and control for this.\n",
    "* **Scaling and Translation:** Scaling and translation are linear maps, and are always followed by another linear map. The composition of two linear maps is another linear map, so we can *fold* the scaling and translation weights into the weights of the subsequent layer, and simplify things without changing the underlying computation. \n",

    "**Tokenization** is one of the most annoying features of studying language models. We want language models to be able to take in arbitrary text as input, but the transformer architecture needs the inputs to be elements of a fixed, finite vocabulary. The solution to this is **tokens**, a fixed vocabulary of \"sub-words\", that any natural language can be broken down into with a **tokenizer**. This is invertible, and we can recover the original text, called **de-tokenization**. \n",

    "`prepend_bos` is a bit of a hack, and I've gone back and forth on what the correct default here is. The reason I do this is that transformers tend to treat the first token weirdly - this doesn't really matter in training (where all inputs are >1000 tokens), but this can be a big issue when investigating short prompts! The reason for this is that attention patterns are a probability distribution and so need to add up to one, so to simulate being \"off\" they normally look at the first token. Giving them a BOS token lets the heads rest by looking at that, preserving the information in the first \"real\" token.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, *some* models are trained to need a BOS token (OPT and my interpretability-friendly models are, GPT-2 and GPT-Neo are not). But despite GPT-2 not being trained with this, empirically it seems to make interpretability easier.\n",

    "## Factored Matrix Class\n",
    "\n",
    "In transformer interpretability, we often need to analyse low rank factorized matrices - a matrix $M = AB$, where M is `[large, large]`, but A is `[large, small]` and B is `[small, large]`. This is a common structure in transformers, and the `FactoredMatrix` class is a convenient way to work with these. It implements efficient algorithms for various operations on these, such as computing the trace, eigenvalues, Frobenius norm, singular value decomposition, and products with other matrices. It can (approximately) act as a drop-in replacement for the original matrix, and supports leading batch dimensions to the factored matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary>Why are low-rank factorized matrices useful for transformer interpretability?</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "As argued in [A Mathematical Framework](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html), an unexpected fact about transformer attention heads is that rather than being best understood as keys, queries and values (and the requisite weight matrices), they're actually best understood as two low rank factorized matrices. \n",
    "* **Where to move information from:** $W_QK = W_Q W_K^T$, used for determining the attention pattern - what source positions to move information from and what destination positions to move them to.\n",
    "    * Intuitively, residual stream -> query and residual stream -> key are linear maps, *and* `attention_score = query @ key.T` is a linear map, so the whole thing can be factored into one big bilinear form `residual @ W_QK @ residual.T`\n",
    "* **What information to move:** $W_OV = W_V W_O$, used to determine what information to copy from the source position to the destination position (weighted by the attention pattern weight from that destination to that source). \n",
    "    * Intuitively, the residual stream is a `[position, d_model]` tensor (ignoring batch). The attention pattern acts on the *position* dimension (where to move information from and to) and the value and output weights act on the *d_model* dimension - ie *what* information is contained at that source position. So we can factor it all into `attention_pattern @ residual @ W_V @ W_O`, and so only need to care about `W_OV = W_V @ W_O`\n",
    "* Note - the internal head dimension is smaller than the residual stream dimension, so the factorization is low rank. (here, `d_model=768` and `d_head=64`)\n",

    "For a more involved example, let's look at the eigenvalue copying score from [A Mathematical Framework](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) of the OV circuit for various heads. The OV Circuit for a head (the factorised matrix $W_OV = W_V W_O$) is a linear map that determines what information is moved from the source position to the destination position. Because this is low rank, it can be thought of as *reading in* some low rank subspace of the source residual stream and *writing to* some low rank subspace of the destination residual stream (with maybe some processing happening in the middle).\n",

    "A common operation for this will just be to *copy*, ie to have the same reading and writing subspace, and to do minimal processing in the middle. Empirically, this tends to coincide with the OV Circuit having (approximately) positive real eigenvalues. I mostly assert this as an empirical fact, but intuitively, operations that involve mapping eigenvectors to different directions (eg rotations) tend to have complex eigenvalues. And operations that preserve eigenvector direction but negate it tend to have negative real eigenvalues. And \"what happens to the eigenvectors\" is a decent proxy for what happens to an arbitrary vector.\n",

Importantly, this technique will work for *any* model architecture, not just transformers, so long as you're able to edit the model code to add in HookPoints!

They find a pretty dramatic shift in models during training - there's a brief period where models go from not having induction heads to having them, which leads to the models suddenly becoming much better at in-context learning (using far back tokens to predict the next token, eg over 500 words back). This is enough of a big deal that it leads to a visible *bump* in the loss curve, where the model's rate of improvement briefly increases. "
