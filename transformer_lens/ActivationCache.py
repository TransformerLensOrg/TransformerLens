"""Activation Cache.

The :class:`ActivationCache` is at the core of Transformer Lens. It is a wrapper that stores all
important activations from a forward pass of the model, and provides a variety of helper functions

Getting Started:

When reading these docs for the first time, we recommend reading the main :class:`ActivationCache`
class first, including the examples, and then skimming the available methods. You can then refer
back to these docs depending on what you need to do.

class ActivationCache:
    """Activation Cache.

    A wrapper that stores all important activations from a forward pass of the model, and provides a
    variety of helper functions to investigate them.

    The :class:`ActivationCache` is at the core of Transformer Lens. It is a wrapper that stores all
    important activations from a forward pass of the model, and provides a variety of helper
    functions to investigate them. The common way to access it is to run the model with
    :meth:`transformer_lens.HookedTransformer.run_with_cache`.

    Examples:

    When investigating a particular behaviour of a modal, a very common first step is to try and
    understand which components of the model are most responsible for that behaviour. For example,
    if you're investigating the prompt "Why did the chicken cross the" -> " road", you might want to
    understand if there is a specific sublayer (mlp or multi-head attention) that is responsible for
    the model predicting "road". This kind of analysis commonly falls under the category of "logit
    attribution" or "direct logit attribution" (DLA).

    >>> from transformer_lens import HookedTransformer
    >>> model = HookedTransformer.from_pretrained("tiny-stories-1M")
    Loaded pretrained model tiny-stories-1M into HookedTransformer

    >>> _logits, cache = model.run_with_cache("Why did the chicken cross the")
    >>> residual_stream, labels = cache.decompose_resid(return_labels=True, mode="attn")
    >>> print(labels[0:3])
    ['embed', 'pos_embed', '0_attn_out']

    >>> answer = " road" # Note the proceeding space to match the model's tokenization
    >>> logit_attrs = cache.logit_attrs(residual_stream, answer)
    >>> print(logit_attrs.shape) # Attention layers
    torch.Size([10, 1, 7])

    >>> most_important_component_idx = torch.argmax(logit_attrs)
    >>> print(labels[most_important_component_idx])
    3_attn_out

    You can also dig in with more granularity, using :meth:`get_full_resid_decomposition` to get the
    residual stream by individual component (mlp neurons and individual attention heads). This
    creates a larger residual stack, but the approach of using :meth"`logit_attrs` remains the same.

    Equally you might want to find out if the model struggles to construct such excellent jokes
    until the very last layers, or if it is trivial and the first few layers are enough. This kind
    of analysis is called "logit lens", and you can find out more about how to do that with
    :meth:`ActivationCache.accumulated_resid`.

    Warning:

    :class:`ActivationCache` is designed to be used with
    :class:`transformer_lens.HookedTransformer`, and will not work with other models. It's also
    designed to be used with all activations of :class:`transformer_lens.HookedTransformer` being
    cached, and some internal methods will break without that.

    The biggest footgun and source of bugs in this code will be keeping track of indexes,
    dimensions, and the numbers of each. There are several kinds of activations:

    * Internal attn head vectors: q, k, v, z. Shape [batch, pos, head_index, d_head].
    * Internal attn pattern style results: pattern (post softmax), attn_scores (pre-softmax). Shape
      [batch, head_index, query_pos, key_pos].
    * Attn head results: result. Shape [batch, pos, head_index, d_model].
    * Internal MLP vectors: pre, post, mid (only used for solu_ln - the part between activation +
      layernorm). Shape [batch, pos, d_mlp].
    * Residual stream vectors: resid_pre, resid_mid, resid_post, attn_out, mlp_out, embed,
      pos_embed, normalized (output of each LN or LNPre). Shape [batch, pos, d_model].
    * LayerNorm Scale: scale. Shape [batch, pos, 1].

    Sometimes the batch dimension will be missing because we applied `remove_batch_dim` (used when
    batch_size=1), and as such all library functions *should* be robust to that.

    Type annotations are in the following form:

    * layers_covered is the number of layers queried in functions that stack the residual stream.
    * batch_and_pos_dims is the set of dimensions from batch and pos - by default this is ["batch",
      "pos"], but is only ["pos"] if we've removed the batch dimension and is [()] if we've removed
      batch dimension and are applying a pos slice which indexes a specific position.

        style analysis, where it can be thought of as what the model "believes" at each point in the
        residual stream.

        To project this into the vocabulary space, remember that there is a final layer norm in most
        decoder-only transformers. Therefore, you need to first apply the final layer norm (which
        can be done with `apply_ln`), and then multiply by the unembedding matrix (:math:`W_U`).

        (e.g. for direct logit attribution), see :meth:`decompose_resid` instead, or
        :meth:`get_full_resid_decomposition` if you want contributions broken down further into each

        calculates how much each item in the stack "contributes" to specific tokens.

        It does this by:
            1. Getting the residual directions of the tokens (i.e. reversing the unembed)
            2. Taking the dot product of each item in the residual stack, with the token residual
               directions.

        Note that if incorrect tokens are provided, it instead takes the difference between the
        correct and incorrect tokens (to calculate the residual directions). This is useful as
        sometimes we want to know e.g. which components are most responsible for selecting the
        correct token rather than an incorrect one. For example in the `Interpretability in the Wild
        paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00593>` prompts such as "John and Mary went to the shops,
        John gave a bag to" were investigated, and it was therefore useful to calculate attribution
        for the :math:`\\text{Mary} - \\text{John}` residual direction.

        Warning:

        Choosing the correct `tokens` and `incorrect_tokens` is both important and difficult. When
        investigating specific components it's also useful to look at it's impact on all tokens
        (i.e. :math:`\\text{final_ln}(\\text{residual_stack_item}) W_U`).

        Takes a stack of components of the residual stream (eg outputs of decompose_resid or
        accumulated_resid), treats them as the input to a specific layer, and applies the layer norm
        scaling of that layer to them, using the cached scale factors - simulating what that
        component of the residual stream contributes to that layer's input.

        The layernorm scale is global across the entire residual stream for each layer, batch
        element and position, which is why we need to use the cached scale factors rather than just
        applying a new LayerNorm.

        If the model does not use LayerNorm or RMSNorm, it returns the residual stack unchanged.

        Args:
            residual_stack:
                A tensor, whose final dimension is d_model. The other trailing dimensions are

                or position dimensions.

                The layer we're taking the input to. In [0, n_layers], n_layers means the unembed.

            mlp_input:
                Whether the input is to the MLP or attn (ie ln2 vs ln1). Defaults to False, ie ln1.

            pos_slice:
                The slice to take of positions, if residual_stack is not over the full context, None
                means do nothing. It is assumed that pos_slice has already been applied to
                residual_stack, and this is only applied to the scale. See utils.Slice for details.
                Defaults to None, do nothing.
